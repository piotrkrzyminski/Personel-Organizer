    <p>This application is based on Staff Organizer app that i created about year ago. From that time a have learned many new things so i       decided to create better application.</p>

  <p>I used Maven to create files structure and download sqLite package from Maven repository. The most important to me was to design         better UI. Below you can compare old and new application look</p>
